# Apple Keynote Presenter Notes Exporter

## Usage:

- Open Apple Script Editor
- Copy and paste the code from exportnotes.applescript
- Press the run key ▶️
- Select a keynote file

A file with the same name + ".txt" is saved in the same folder as the keynote file.

## Save for future use

Apple Script Editor let's you export the script as "exportnotes.scpt" or "exportnotes.app" so you can use it from the dock.
